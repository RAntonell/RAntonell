## Hi, I'm Roger

Frontend developer with 7 years of experience building interfaces for real products.

I work on design systems, component architecture, and keeping UIs consistent as products scale.

### Background

I have spent most of my career on product teams, working closely with designers and maintaining codebases over the long term.

I have built and evolved design systems across platforms and contributed to migrating legacy setups to modern React and TypeScript.

### What's here

A small set of projects that show how I actually work.  
Application structure, state management, component composition, and testing.

Real product patterns rather than tutorial demos.

### Stack

React • TypeScript • Next.js • modern CSS • design systems

I care about maintainable code and shipping quality work.
